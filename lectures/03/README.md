# Football Stats

A football team has played five games.

A program needs to read the results of the five games, and then display the margin of the biggest win, the margin of the biggest loss, and the overall goal difference.

Results are entered in the form "F-A", with goals scored followed by goals against. For example, "2-0", or "1-3".
